# Prime number and primitive root
p = 23
g = 5

# Private keys (chosen secretly)
a = 6  # Alice
b = 15 # Bob

# Public keys (shared openly)
A = pow(g, a, p)  # Alice's public key
B = pow(g, b, p)  # Bob's public key

# Shared secret (calculated independently)
secret_a = pow(B, a, p)
secret_b = pow(A, b, p)

# Output
print("Shared Secret (Alice):", secret_a)
